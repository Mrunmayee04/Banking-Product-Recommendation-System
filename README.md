# Banking-Product-Recommendation-System
Generates an end-to-end customer analytics and product recommendation system for Santander Bank.

<br>
Using the publicly accessible Santander Product Recommendation dataset, this project creates an end-to-end customer analytics and product recommendation system for Santander Bank. The goal is to improve the bank’s ability to deliver personalized, high-impact product recommendations while understanding customer behavior at a granular level. The study integrates three analytical pillars: behavioral segmentation using RFM and K-Medoids clustering, multi-label product recommendation using XGBoost, and churn prediction using supervised learning.

Over 13 million raw customer-product snapshots were cleaned and preprocessed, transaction histories were analyzed, and 47 behavioral and demographic variables were engineered. Value-based product metadata was produced using a thorough data engineering workflow. Results verify that, in comparison to demographic segmentation alone, behavioral segmentation offers a much deeper understanding of consumer value. While K-Medoids provided stable and significant clusters even under skewed monetary distributions, XGBoost generated precise, comprehensible suggestions across a variety of items. Strong AUC scores in churn prediction and strong alignment rates (96–100%) between cluster-level expectations and anticipated recommendations were attained by the final hybrid model. This system presents a production-ready, scalable methodology that can lead to enhanced retention, targeted marketing, and quantifiable financial impact.
