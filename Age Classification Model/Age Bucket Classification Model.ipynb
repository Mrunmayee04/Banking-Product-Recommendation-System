The objective of this modelling task was to assess whether age cohorts can be accurately inferred from behavioural patterns alone—including spending intensity, account tenure, portfolio engagement, transaction frequency, and product diversity. Establishing this behavioural,lifecycle relationship provides insight into how strongly observable customer actions encode age-related characteristics. This, in turn, enables applications such as privacy-preserving personalization, data-driven marketing segmentation, and early identification of product needs across different age groups within the customer base."],"metadata":{"id":"qtes4tp45q44"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install scikit-learn-extra

Training a model on this distribution would bias predictions toward the dominant class, resulting in inflated accuracy and reduced sensitivity to minority groups. To mitigate this issue, Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied exclusively to the training set. SMOTE generates synthetic minority-class samples through interpolation, enabling the model to learn representative patterns for under-represented groups without duplicating existing observations. After oversampling, all three age segments were evenly represented in the training data, ensuring balanced learning, improved recall for minority classes, and reduced risk of majority-class bias."],"metadata":{"id":"0xI1IULH70GD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE\n","\n","# Define X and y\n","X_2 = df_2class.drop(columns=[\"age\", \"age_bucket_3\", \"first_join_date\", \"cluster_name\"])\n","y_2 = df_2class[\"age_bucket_3\"]\n","\n","# Encode age labels into integers\n","le2 = LabelEncoder()\n","y_2_encoded = le2.fit_transform(y_2)\n","\n","# Train-test split\n","X_train2, X_test2, y_train2, y_test2 = train_test_split(\n","    X_2, y_2_encoded,\n","    test_size=0.2,\n","    random_state=42,\n","    stratify=y_2_encoded\n",")\n","\n","print(\"Before SMOTE:\", pd.Series(y_train2).value_counts())\n","\n","# Apply SMOTE only to training data\n","sm = SMOTE(random_state=42, sampling_strategy='auto')\n","X_train2_res, y_train2_res = sm.fit_resample(X_train2, y_train2)\n","\n","print(\"After SMOTE:\", pd.Series(y_train2_res).value_counts())"],"metadata":{"id":"trxSI6Dy4R6A","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764625633080,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":2499,"user":{"displayName":"Mrunmayee Mahesh Labde","userId":"00679018554867910045"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"ff3abff7-c265-4b2e-d36a-86d406d3cd43"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Before SMOTE: 0    54111\n","1    27167\n","2     2640\n","Name: count, dtype: int64\n","After SMOTE: 1    54111\n","0    54111\n","2    54111\n","Name: count, dtype: int64\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install lightgbm\n"],"metadata":{"id":"wBPr5PXwErZI","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1764625643625,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4545,"user":{"displayName":"Mrunmayee Mahesh Labde","userId":"00679018554867910045"}},"outputId":"4a10a6fc-ea01-4b01-8ea5-412e0e7fbfdc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: lightgbm in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (4.6.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: numpy>=1.17.0 in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from lightgbm) (1.26.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: scipy in /usr/local/lib/python3.12/dist-packages (from lightgbm) (1.16.3)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["A comparative evaluation was conducted using three supervised learning algorithms—Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM—to assess their ability to classify customers into the three engineered age segments. These models were selected for their strong performance on structured financial data and their capacity to model non-linear relationships among behavioural, demographic, and RFM-based predictors. All models were trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset and evaluated on the original, imbalanced validation set to measure real-world generalization.\n","\n","Across all experiments, the models achieved similar overall accuracy (61%–65%). However, class-level performance demonstrated clear patterns. The Mid (36–50) group consistently achieved the highest recall due to its large representation and more stable behavioural profile. The Young (18–35) segment achieved moderate recall, reflecting their smaller sample size and more dynamic financial behaviour. The Older (50+) segment remained the most difficult to classify, likely due to behavioural overlap with middle-aged customers, particularly in income, tenure, and product-holding patterns.\n","\n","Overall, these results indicate that customer behaviour contains meaningful—but not fully distinct—signals related to age segmentation. Mid-life customer patterns are most learnable, while younger and older groups exhibit higher behavioural variability. This suggests that age prediction from behavioural data is feasible but would benefit from additional features or temporal data to further separate overlapping lifecycle patterns."],"metadata":{"id":"41rgF9k59IES"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier\n","\n","\n","from xgboost import XGBClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, f1_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder #
